# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.
# Feel free to amend for your own requirements.

# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'capture' mode, which is best suited to
# comparing a test and live version of the same website.
#
# `wraith capture capture.yaml`

##############################################################

# (required) The engine to run Wraith with. Examples: 'phantomjs', 'casperjs', 'slimerjs'
# with chrome we can capture and process about 15 pages in one resolution per minute
browser: "chrome"

# (required) The domains to take screenshots of.
domains:
  current:  "http://www.example.com"
  new:      "http://develop.example.com"

# (required) The paths to capture. All paths should exist for both of the domains specified above.
# paths:
#  home:     /
#  about:    /about
#  contact:  /get-in-touch

imports: "spider_paths.yaml"

# A list of URLs to skip when spidering.
# Ruby regular expressions can be used, if prefixed with `!ruby/regexp` as defined in the YAML Cookbookâ€‹.
# See http://www.yaml.org/YAML_for_ruby.html#regexps
spider_skips:
#  - /foo/bar.html           # Matches /foo/bar.html explicitly
#  - !ruby/regexp /^\/fr\// # Matches any URLs that start with /fr/
#  - !ruby/regexp /\/blog\// # Matches any URLs that has /blog/
  - !ruby/regexp /^\/fileadmin\// # Matches any URLs that start with /fileadmin
  - !ruby/regexp /^\/typo3/ # Matches any URLs that start with /typo3

# (required) Screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot.
screen_widths:
#  - 320
  - 480
#  - 600x768
#  - 768
  - 1024
  - 1280

# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
#before_capture: 'javascript/disable_javascript--phantom.js'

# (required) The directory that your screenshots will be stored in
directory: 'shots/customer/domain'

# (required) Amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use when comparing images. A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.
fuzz: '20%'

# (optional) The maximum acceptable level of difference (in %) between two images before Wraith reports a failure. Default: 0
threshold: 5

# (optional) Specify the template (and generated thumbnail sizes) for the gallery output.
gallery:
  template: 'basic_template' # Examples: 'basic_template' (default), 'slideshow_template'
  thumb_width:  200
  thumb_height: 200

# (optional) Choose which results are displayed in the gallery, and in what order. Default: alphanumeric
# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
mode: diffs_first

# misc performance options
# default: chrome reloads every size. if uncommented, chrome resizes the window the  
# resize_or_reload: resize

# default: 8. If uncommented, runs with 32 threads, might cause issues on slower machines
# threads: 32

# wait for x seconds in chrome for the page to settle. reduces possibility of "Page is being generated" warnings but slows the rendering
# settle: 2
